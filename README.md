# NessuStrip
Strip hosts and report items from those unwieldy Nessus XML files.

### Installation

NessuStrip requires [Docopt](http://docopt.org/) and [Lxml](https://lxml.de/), .

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd NessuStrip
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
### Todos

 - Add additional strippers
 - Seems to have problems with output files that include spaces
